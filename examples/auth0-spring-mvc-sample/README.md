## Simple Application demonstrating Auth0 Lock login and home page using Spring

### Prerequisites

In order to run this example you will need to have Java 7+ and Maven installed.

Check that your maven version is 3.0.x or above:

```sh
mvn -v
```

This project relies upon `Spring Boot`.


Benefits of Spring Boot, in particular for traditional server-side web application / microservices architectures:

**Automatic configuration** - Spring Boot can automatically provide configuration for application functionality common to many Spring applications.

**Starter dependencies** - Tell Spring Boot what kind of functionality you need, and it will ensure that the libraries needed are added to the build.

**Command-line interface** - Optional feature of Spring Boot lets you write complete applications with just application code, but no need for a traditional
 project build.

**The Actuator** - Gives you insight into what's going on inside of a running Spring Boot application.


### Setup

Create an [Auth0 Account](https://auth0.com) (if not already done so - free!).


#### From the Auth0 Dashboard

Create an application - for the purposes of this sample - `app`

Ensure you add the following to the settings.

Allowed Callback URL:

```
http://localhost:3099/callback
```

Ensure you add the following to the settings.

Allowed Logout URLs:

```
http://localhost:3099/logout
```

Add one or more `connections` to your application - for instance Google Social Connection,
or username-password DB connection.


### Inside the Application - update configuration information

Enter your:

`client_id`, `client_secret`, and `domain` information into `src/main/resources/auth0.properties`


### Build and Run

In order to build and run the project execute:

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then, go to [http://localhost:3099/login](http://localhost:3099/login).

Finally, in addition, using Spring Boot `actuator` we can easily verify various health and performance statistics for our running application.

Here are just a few of the available endpoints:

```
http://localhost:3099/metrics
http://localhost:3099/health
http://localhost:3099/mappings
http://localhost:3099/env
```
